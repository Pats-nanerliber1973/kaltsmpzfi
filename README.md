Dude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Amateur, and honestly, I’m having all kinds of w𝘩𝘢𝘤𝘬ed-out feelings. You know that moment when you're trying to make sense of something, but it’s like your brain’s just bouncing around like a pair of sneakers in a washing machine? Yeah, that.

First off, who even names a   The Amateur? Like, wow, really selling it. 😂 But seriously, it somehow worked, not gonna lie. The whole vibe was kinda raw but real, like my initial sketches for a new sneaker—still a mess but with potential. You ever just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and then kinda get blindsided by the whole plot? Like, it’s more than what you bargained for, haha. 

> There was this scene where I was just like... WHAT? Kinda felt like the moment when you're sure you’ve found the perfect shade for a sneaker, and then BAM, lighting in the factory makes it look totally off. Such a rollercoaster.

You know what I mean, right? Like, it’s got that flow you didn't expect. While 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it, I was thinking about how different each character’s style was, haha. Creeping ideas for a new shoe line, maybe... sneakers by characters. Could work! Midway through, I started doodling some designs, nothing serious, just letting the imagination flow like a 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 of half-baked ideas. They got me in that headspace, man. 

Speaking of headspace, the music was just on point, but sometimes it felt like when you lay down the wrong colorway in a shoe and it somehow works—sort of abstract but not confusing. Like trying to explain why I love vintage design. Feels nonsensical but makes sense in my head.

printf(Why did I even write this?); // I guess I'm as all over the place as the   lol

Anyway, might even 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, just to see what I missed while my mind was drifting. If you haven’t seen it yet, do yourself a favor. It’s worth the ride, I swear. Catch you later, I’ve got some sneaker sketches to daydream about. 😴👟
